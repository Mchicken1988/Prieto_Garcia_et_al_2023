This GitHub Page provides the rendered HTML-Reports comprising
the figures and results of Prieto-Garcia et al. 2023 published in XXX.

# Effect of USP39 knockdown on splicing

[1_effect_of_USP39_KD_on_splicing.html](1_effect_of_USP39_KD_on_splicing.html) 
includes the splicing analysis and characterization of A5SS events.

# Generation of peptide and adjusted SWISSPROT sequences

[2_generate_peptide_and_adjusted_SWISSPROT_sequences.html](2_generate_peptide_and_adjusted_SWISSPROT_sequences.html) 
provides the code for the generation of peptide sequences from A5SS events and
their incorporation into SWISS-PROT sequences.

# RNA splicing maps and A5SS event features

[3_RNAmaps_and_features.html](3_RNAmaps_and_features.html) includes the description
of the RNA splicing maps and the analysis of A5SS event features.

# FAS score analysis

[4_FASscore_analysis.html](4_FASscore_analysis.html) includes the analysis
of domain architecture changes due to A5SS events based on computed FAS scores.
